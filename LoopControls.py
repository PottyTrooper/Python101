# for loop

# while loop
# It is used when we're certain about the number of repetitions
# But we know the condition for which the loop has to remain active
# loop manipulation techniques
# 1. To alter the execution speed/frequency of a loop
# 2. Break - Terminate the loop immediately
# 3. continue - The continue statement exits the current iteration
#               and starts a new iteration immediately!
